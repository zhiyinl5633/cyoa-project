You have just declined you offer to work for one of the most prestigious and well known companies. Your only hope is to go to your best friend whom you've known since you were in elementay school. You tell him/her everything that happened and she/he simpathizes with you. They allow you to stay at their place. Lucky for you, your best friend's parents own a really popular store that sells clothing. You and your friend work there until you two have enough money to start your own business or make your friend's business become really big. You become determined because maybe you can have the chance to go to college and make you mom proud. For the next few years, the job you are working at is amazing and is really fun. You have also saved some money to go to college. Everything is going well and you can't be happier. A few months later, you start your first day at a university and meeting new people. You and your friend has also opened up a new store that is chained to the store you are working in right now. You have never felt so happy. Your life feels complete and you can spend the rest of your life happy.
